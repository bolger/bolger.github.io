[Mind Maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) are one of the most important and valuable tools I use in my working life. I use them every single day. I like mind maps because they:

>* are a great communication tool
	* enable structured communication
		* most important themes as top level concepts
		* elaborate concepts as child nodes
		* aligns very loosely with Barbara Minto's [Pyramid Principle](http://www.barbaraminto.com/concept.html)
		* allows readers to navigate / consume information quickly and efficiently
			* by navigating the hierarchy as deep as they need to to get at the concepts that interest them the most.
	* expressive while being succinct
	* Suit many audiences
		* my future self
		* others
* help me structure my thinking
	* by providing a framework for me to elaborate my thoughts

There are loads of great Mind Mapping tools out there and I have tried many of them. My tool of choice for Mind Mapping these days is my favourite text editor, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). 

Wikipedia defines Mind Mapping as a way to visually organise information. Using a bulleted list with indents is a way of visually organising information. I've already done it right in this blog post (above in my reasons why I like Mind Maps). I use text based Mind Maps in preference to tool based diagrammatic maps because:

>* I am more productive when creating text based Mind Maps
	* I am not forced to think top down
		* Visual diagram based tools push you towards having to think top down by defining a central topic, then branching off to create sub-topics
			* You don't have to work this way. You could define nodes ad hoc and move them around
				* In practice it doesn't work as well for me as the text based approach: I find it stifles my thought patterns because it is not free form.
		* Text based solution allows me to free form brain dump, then easily organise into a hierarchy as patterns start to emerge
	* I can do everything using just a keyboard
		* using the keyboard with shortcuts I am used to because I am a Software Developer and editors are my life!
* Every computer has the right tool to view/edit them
	* Notepad
	* Emacs
	* TextMate
	* Sublime Text
		* which, if you save your mind map with a .md extensive (MarkDown) does node folding for you (see image below)
	* etc
* I can easily share them with others
	* Give them my text file
	* Copy/Paste into an email

I've tried [MindManager](http://www.mindjet.com/mindmanager/) (expensive), [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) (free, but lacklustre UI), [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/) (free for non-commercial use, great UI), [MindMeister](https://www.mindmeister.com/) (free for limited number of maps, cloud based). Some of these tools are ordinary, some are really good, but I just can't go past plain old text for the reasons outlined above.
