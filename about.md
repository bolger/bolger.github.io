Hi, I'm Daniel Bolger.

I'm a software engineer who believes strongly in software craftmanship and I strive to be better at my craft every single day. I am passionate about writing maintainable code. I am deeply interested in processes, methods and tooling that enable me to be productive and deliver software efficiently.

I hold a Bachelor of Applied Science (Computer Science) from [RMIT University](http://www.rmit.edu.au). I am a continuous learner.
